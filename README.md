# docker-oracle
 
Quick Start <br>

Run a new database container (data is removed when the container is removed, but kept throughout container restarts): <br>
docker run -d -p 1521:1521 -e ORACLE_PASSWORD=<your password> gvenzl/oracle-free <br>

Run a new persistent database container (data is kept throughout container lifecycles): <br>
docker run -d -p 1521:1521 -e ORACLE_PASSWORD=<your password> -v oracle-volume:/opt/oracle/oradata gvenzl/oracle-free <br>

Reset database SYS and SYSTEM passwords: <br>
docker exec <container name|id> resetPassword <your password> <br>

How to use this image: <br>
Environment variables <br>
Environment variables allow you to customize your container. Note that these variables will only be considered during the database initialization (first container startup).<br><br>

ORACLE_PASSWORD<br>
This variable is mandatory for the first container startup and specifies the password for the Oracle Database SYS and SYSTEM users.

ORACLE_RANDOM_PASSWORD<br>
This is an optional variable. Set this variable to a non-empty value, like yes, to generate a random initial password for the SYS and SYSTEM users. The generated password will be printed to stdout (ORACLE PASSWORD FOR SYS AND SYSTEM: ...).

ORACLE_DATABASE<br>
This is an optional variable. Set this variable to a non-empty string to create a new pluggable database with the name specified in this variable.
Note: creating a new database will add to the initial container startup time. If you do not want that additional startup time, use the already existing FREEPDB1 database instead.

APP_USER<br>
This is an optional variable. Set this variable to a non-empty string to create a new database schema user with the name specified in this variable. For 18c and onwards, the user will be created in the default FREEPDB1 pluggable database. If ORACLE_DATABASE has been specified, the user will also be created in that pluggable database. This variable requires APP_USER_PASSWORD or APP_USER_PASSWORD_FILE to be specified as well.

APP_USER_PASSWORD<br>
This is an optional variable. Set this variable to a non-empty string to define a password for the database schema user specified by APP_USER. This variable requires APP_USER to be specified as well.
